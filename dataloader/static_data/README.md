The data used in the application is acquired from the following sources, should it need updating:

# Pool locations
https://www.toronto.ca/data/parks/assets/xml/pools.xml

This link was acquired by going to the pools map page https://www.toronto.ca/data/parks/maps/pools/index.html and inspecting where it loads data from. The file contains all the data we need for the locations including address, name, coordinates, and phone number.

# Pool schedules

There are several pages that show pool times, they are all linked from https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/recreation/swimming-splash-pads/drop-in-swimming/

There are different types of swimming like lane, family, preschool, etc. Each of them has their own page that needs to be scraped.
